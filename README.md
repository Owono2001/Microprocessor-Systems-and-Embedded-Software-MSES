# Microprocessor-Systems-and-Embedded-Software-MSES
For the Microprocessor Systems and Embedded Software (MSES) assignment, our group designed and developed a firefighting and rescue robot. This autonomous robot is equipped with sensors like ultrasonic, infrared, gas, and temperature sensors to detect obstacles, fires, and environmental hazards. It also features a DC water pump for extinguishing fires and a robotic arm for debris removal and rescue tasks. The robot's design integrates embedded software for control and navigation, utilizing real-time sensor data and autonomous decision-making for efficient firefighting.
