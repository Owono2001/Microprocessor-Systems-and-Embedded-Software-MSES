# Microprocessor-Systems-and-Embedded-Software-MSES
For the Machine Vision and Intelligence assignment, our group designed and implemented a firefighting and rescue robot capable of autonomous navigation and hazard detection. The robot uses a variety of sensors, including ultrasonic, infrared, gas, and temperature sensors, to detect obstacles, identify fires, and assess environmental conditions. It is also equipped with a DC water pump for firefighting, a robotic arm for handling objects, and a camera system for real-time feedback. The project combined mechanical design, sensor integration, and control systems, showcasing advanced robotics for emergency response.
